# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-09)

**Core value:** The load-bearing paths — fetch, parse, read, download galleries — keep working; every task is a foundation change held to behavior/appearance parity.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Isolated Dependency Modernization

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Isolated Dependency Modernization) — EXECUTING
Plan: 7 of 7
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-10 — Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Combine→async/await (Phase 4) stays in this milestone, sequenced after the isolated dep removals.
- Roadmap: WaterfallGrid→Layout (Phase 2) and SwiftUIPager→TabView (Phase 3) are spike-first — validate feasibility before committing.
- Roadmap: Fold cookies→Keychain + networking/cookie/image tests + `.private.filterValue` fix into their open seams (Phases 8–9); defer Parser/Download refactors.
- Roadmap: LINT-01 split — mechanical rules sweep last (Phase 11); refactor-gated rules land with their refactors (`optional_try`→Phase 9; binding/lifecycle/unchecked-subscript→Phases 5–7).
- [Phase ?]: 01-01: Dropped invalid -testPlan FeatureTests from AppPackage-Package commands (plan bound to EhPanda scheme; package scheme runs all test targets)
- [Phase ?]: 01-01: Wave 0 parity fixtures lock current SwiftyOpenCC (default/HK/TW + full color) and UIImageColors RGBA output before DEP-01/DEP-02 swaps
- [Phase ?]: 01-02: Wave 0 markdown fixtures target current CommonMarkExt.MarkdownUtil; MarkdownExtTests name reserves MarkdownExt (D-09) with no app-owned Markdown module
- [Phase ?]: 01-02: DF semantics locked via pure request transforms + DFRequest header assembly, resume() never called (no live networking, D-13); real-world DF stays manual
- [Phase ?]: 01-02: Wave 0 complete (DEP-01/02/03/06 baselines locked); nyquist_compliant true
- [Phase ?]: 01-03: Replaced external ddddxxx/SwiftyOpenCC with an app-owned local SwiftyOpenCC module backed by an internal copencc C++14 target; Wave 0 parity fixtures pass verbatim.
- [Phase ?]: DEP-02: vendored a clean-room local UIImageColors module (getColors preserved verbatim); external jathu/UIImageColors removed.
- [Phase ?]: DEP-03: markdown parsing migrated to Apple swift-markdown 0.8.0 behind MarkdownExt; SwiftCommonMark/CommonMarkExt removed; parity fixtures unchanged (D-07/D-08/D-09)
- [Phase ?]: DEP-06 resolved as document-skip: DeprecatedAPI deliberately retained (D-12); no warning-free replacement preserves host-control + arbitrary-Host + original-domain-trust, so removal would weaken D-14.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- Phase 8 (QUAL-02): NetworkingFeature tests couple to Phase 4's async migration but land in the hygiene phase (where CookieClient/ImageClient are reworked) — verify NetworkingFeature parity tests are written against the migrated async layer, not deferred silently.
- Phases 2 & 3 carry genuine parity risk (spike-gated); a failed spike must surface before committing implementation.
